Generic toolbox for spectral oceanwaves plus SWAN IO toolbox

The oceanwaves package contains general classes for 1D and 2D spectral wave data.
The classes come with plot functions, and functions to integrate spectral parameters
on-the-fly. The oceanwaves classes are meant to be used for a series of packages for IO
from different waver sources. Here we implemented the use of oceanwaves as a basis for 
swan IO, but we foresee additional packages for various bouy suppliers and other wave models.
